<!--
Overall, your page should look as similar to Instagram as possible, and include
the following elements:
  {x} Header bar with logo, search box, and icons
  {x} header does shrinking effect when you scroll
  {x} search box should include background color change on "focus" but other
     changes do not need to be re-created
Main content area:
  {x} Must contain 2 image posts with a caption
  {x} Must contain "suggestions for you" section
  {x} Sidebar with profile info, stories, and footer links.
  {x} Make sure sidebar is stationary while you scroll on the page (may want to
     look at position: sticky, but not necessary)
  {x} Make sure stories area has too much content to fit and scrolls
  {x} Your page should have responsive behavior like Instagram, where around
     tablet size the sidebar disappears and the main section is centered. This
     can be accomplished using Bootstrap or your own media queries.

W3Schools Was Consulted for some syntax of CSS
All images were retrieved from google images
Icons were retrieved from flatIcon.com
Fonts were retrieved from daFont.com
